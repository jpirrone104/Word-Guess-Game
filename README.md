# SailorMoon-Word-Guess-Game
Week 3 HW assignment 

This game takes me back to my youth, when I would spend my day visiting Sailormoon fan pages built on Tripod, Angelfire, and Geocities! 

I created this game using javascript - no jQuery was allowed for this assignment. 

To win the game, guess the name of the Negaverse villian. Here is the list of available words: 

"beryl"
"jadeite"
"nephlyte"
"zoisite"
"malachite"
"metalia"
